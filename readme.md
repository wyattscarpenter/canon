The Canon
An Explanation

Hello, and welcome to Carpenter's _Canon_, a list of every important text.

Alternate Names:

I have previously considered this project under the titles World Canon, Philosophical Canon, Philosophy Canon, and readeverybookeverwritten.notreally

Epistemic Status:

I have no training in any field that would let me confidently analyze the provenance of any text. I throw myself here on the mercy of experts, and also on the mercy of people who relay to me, with sometimes greater or lesser accuracy, what expert consensus is.

Motivation:

I mainly started this project in order to have a chronological record of every important book, so I could read them in order. I began mainy by copying wikipedia (see considerations in the copyright section far below to see why this is perfectly legal), an internet-based community-collaborative encyclopedia, though I did not begin my project on wikipedia out of fear they would delete it for being too good and too detailed. See this essay by Gwern Branwen for more on that fear: https://www.gwern.net/In-Defense-Of-Inclusionism

I was initially interested in the philosophical canon, but my interests expanded to the biblical canon, the literary canon, etc, until I felt like I should have a project about all canons. Ideally I would have a database of every book ever written, and simply rank them by influence, but that seems hard.

Inclusion:

My inclusion of texts on this list is necessarily not objective, though I don't believe it is particularly idiosyncratic.

This list is concerned only with books, plays, poems, and other written/printed textual material. Movies and paintings are not considered. Though some day my "mission creep" may eventually include them.

There is a certain amount of arbitrariness in what I consider a single work. For instance, while "the Bible" is often considered as a work as a whole, I catalogue all of the books of the bible individually (this also aids the categorization of multiple versions of the bible with different books included). However, I list the Epistle to the Philippians as one book, even though scholars believe it is composed of three separate letters. 

Before a certain date, every book yet surviving is notable. I don't know when this point is, but I suspect it's certainly before 1460, which would be several years after the Gutenberg Bible and thus the inception of a new culture of text-production. Note, however, that physical artefacts like the Gutenberg Bible are NOT what this list is about, this list is about the texts themselves. No new editions or translations of a work would be considered as separate entities for inclusion on this list unless the revision was extremely radical (in which case, the revision may be considered the canonical version of the work).

After a certain date, a work is too recent for me to form an opinion about whether it's notable. I think this is certainly no less than 10 years in the past. Many things more recent than 10 years ago seem notable but are completely without staying power.

Should lost works be included in this list? In favor of this, we have the notion that a work may be influential even if it is lost. Against this, we have the notion that the point of this list is to read all of them, which cannot be done with lost works. I expect populating this list will expose me to many examples with which I shall make up my mind.

Should transcribed speeches like The Gettysburg Address be allowed? Maybe. How about legal opinions? Possibly, though as (in a sense) technical documents, they hold little interest to most readers, so it is unlikely. Presumably, the United States Declaration of Independence will be included, as non-lawyers occasionally quote it. This suggests immediately the inclusion of the Magna Carta and various manifestos...

There are currently no plans to host in this project any of the texts here catalogued. Instead, the _Canon_ links to copies of the text in wikisource, the internet archive, librivox, and project gutenberg. I so no reason why I would revise this policy unless one or several of those websites disappeared. Currently, the policy is to link only to public domain texts, though I may consider revising that policy later.

Files / Structure :

canon.csv is the main meat of the project. It is the list of every important text ever written, as a csv (Comma Separated Value). This file should conform to RFC 4180 which can be found at https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180 or https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt, though I edit the file with a spreadsheet program and don't vet the produced file. Some categories of data have multiple entries per work (eg the multiple alternative names for a work) and after great consideration I have chosen to place those in a single field of the CSV, separated from each other with the pipe character |. If there is ever a notable work with the pipe character in its name I will be very annoyed and have to revise this choice.

From canon.csv, a visualization of the list is generated.

Conventions:

This project was begun in 2021 in the United States of America and uses the conventions of that time. In particular, years are listed in accordance with ISO 8601. This is equivalent to the Gregorian calendar except years 1 BC is labeled year 0000, 2 BC is labeled year -0001, and so on. The names of works listed are their (US) English names, though sometimes the work may be referred to in English by a name from a non-English language.

Copyright / Lincense / Release:

Under United States of America copyright law, this collection is ineligible for copyright as it is a list arranged in a non-creative manner (chronologically). However, the USA is not the only country, my selection of works may be seen as creative, and this explanation is certainly an original composition, so I may be seen to hold a copyright over some aspects of this project. I wish to hold no copyright on this project, so it may become a truly public resource. Therefore, I release this entire project under the CC0 license, which may be found at https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode or in the license.txt of this project (note that the legal code itself has also been released into the public domain by the Creative Commons organization https://creativecommons.org/policies#licensing%20statement).

TODO:
Make a big CSV of evey important text thus far.
Figure out how to cite things (this may be a pain).
Create the visualization.

Love,
Wyatt S Carpenter
